    "text": "Hello, my name is Yuchen Li (Julian Li), and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science (MDS) at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I have a strong passion for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and possess solid programming and analytical skills. I am proficient in data analysis tools such as Python, R, and SQL.\nFor my undergraduate studies, I majored in Statistics at Tongji University’s School of Mathematical Sciences, where I received multiple academic scholarships and honors. Additionally, I expanded my global perspective through exchange programs at the Technical University of Madrid and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nIn terms of work experience, I interned at ByteDance as a Commercial Data Science Intern, focusing on optimizing native advertising and influencer marketing strategies. I applied A/B testing and XGBoost to improve advertising revenue and organic traffic. During my internship at Shanghai DW Intelligence, I conducted in-depth research on high-frequency futures contract trading, using Pandas and Numpy to build Alpha factors and optimize backtesting. I have also participated in several academic research projects, such as analyzing the heart rate variability of pregnant women using mixed linear models, and forecasting Bitcoin price trends using machine learning models.\nNice to meet you, and thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or chat."
